Hi Daniel A Hale,


Just kidding.  It was used to be $130 but it's now $6.95.




Rock..Baby..Rock.. 
This mother and baby bears set inspires the most enchanting atmosphere.  
This crystal contains 24% to 30% lead 
with strict quality control. 
They were specifically ordered by oversea distributors to be sold to department 
stores. Due to the Economic downturn, the distributor went bankrupt, 
which also brought down the manufacturer. We were able to pick up the inventory 
at pennies on a dollar. We just pass the saving to you. 
That's why you're seeing rediculus prices here.
