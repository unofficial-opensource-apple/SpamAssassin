This interface is distributed under the same license as perl itself, i.e.
either the Artistic License (COPYING.Artistic) or the GPL (COPYING.GNU).

However, the uulib library itself (see the subdirectory uulib) is ONLY
distributed under the GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (COPYING.GNU). Depending on
how you link it together (normally static) this makes the whole package
fall under the GPL.

If you make modifications, please consider sending them to me,
