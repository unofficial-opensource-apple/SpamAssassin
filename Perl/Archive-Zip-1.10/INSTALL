To make and test, do the following:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

To copy the libs and docs to the right places,
do this (as superuser or administrator):
	make install

If you're using Windows, you probably have to first get nmake to make this
work.  If you have the ActiveState distribution, read the part about installing
modules from CPAN.

Then:
	perl Makefile.PL
	nmake
	nmake test
	nmake install


If you don't have the Info-Zip tools zip and unzip installed, you will
get warnings from "make test" or "nmake test". Don't worry about these.

Actually, if you're using ActiveState's ActivePerl on Windows
you should first check for up to date .PPM versions and use their PPM tool
to install them.

You can find an up-to-date PPM version of Compress::Zlib on my website
at http://bike-nomad.com/perl
