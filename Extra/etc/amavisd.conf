#GENERAL NOTES:
#  This file is a normal Perl code, interpreted by Perl itself.
#  - make sure this file (or directory where it resides) is NOT WRITABLE
#    by mere mortals, otherwise it represents a severe security risk!
#  - for values which are interpreted as booleans, it is recommended
#    to use 1 for true, and 0 or undef or '' for false.
#    THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM OLDER AMAVIS VERSIONS where "no" also meant false,
#    now it means true, like any nonempty string does!
#  - Perl syntax applies. Most notably: strings in "" may include variables
#    (which start with $ or @); to include characters @ and $ in double
#    quoted strings, precede them by a backslash; in single-quoted strings
#    the $ and @ lose their special meaning, so it is usually easier to use
#    single quoted strings. Still, in both cases a backslash need to be doubled
#  - variables with names starting with a '@' are lists, the values assigned
#    to them should be lists as well, e.g. ('one@foo', $mydomain, "three");
#    note the comma-separation and parenthesis. If strings in the list
#    do not contain spaces nor variables, a Perl operator qw() may be used
#    as a shorthand to split its argument on whitespace and produce a list
#    of strings, e.g. qw( one@foo example.com three );  Note that the argument
#    to qw is quoted implicitly and no variable interpretation is done within
#    (no '$' variable evaluations). The #-initiated comments can not be used
#    within the string. In other words, $ and # lose their special meaning
#    withing a qw argument, just like within '...' strings.
#  - all e-mail addresses in this file and as used internally by the daemon
#    are in their raw (rfc2821-unquoted and nonbracketed) form, i.e. 
#    Bob "Funny" Dude@example.com, not: "Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com
#    and not <"Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com>; also: '' and not '<>'.


#
# Section I - Essential daemon and MTA settings
#

# $MYHOME serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# $MYHOME is not used directly by the program. No trailing slash!
#$MYHOME = '/var/lib/amavis';   # (default is '/var/amavis')

# : $mydomain serves as a quick default for some other configuration settings.
# : More refined control is available with each individual setting further down.
# : $mydomain is never used directly by the program.
$mydomain = 'example.com';      # (no useful default)

# Set the user and group to which the daemon will change if started as root
# (otherwise just keep the UID unchanged, and these settings have no effect):
$daemon_user  = 'clamav';	# (no default;  customary: vscan or amavis)
$daemon_group = 'clamav';	# (no default;  customary: vscan or amavis)

# Runtime working directory (cwd), and a place where
# temporary directories for unpacking mail are created.
# (no trailing slash, may be a scratch file system)
$TEMPBASE = $MYHOME;	        # (must be set if other config vars use is)
#$TEMPBASE = "$MYHOME/tmp";     # prefer to keep home dir /var/amavis clean?

# $helpers_home sets environment variable HOME, and is passed as option
# 'home_dir_for_helpers' to Mail::SpamAssassin::new. It should be a directory
# on a normal persistent file system, not a scratch or temporary file system
#$helpers_home = $MYHOME;	# (defaults to $MYHOME)

#$daemon_chroot_dir = $MYHOME;  # (default is undef, meaning: do not chroot)

#$pid_file  = "$MYHOME/amavisd.pid";  # (default is "$MYHOME/amavisd.pid")
#$lock_file = "$MYHOME/amavisd.lock"; # (default is "$MYHOME/amavisd.lock")

# set environment variables if you want (no defaults):
$ENV{TMPDIR} = $TEMPBASE;       # wise, but usually not necessary
#...

# MTA SETTINGS, UNCOMMENT AS APPROPRIATE,
# both $forward_method and $notify_method default to 'smtp:127.0.0.1:10025'

# POSTFIX, or SENDMAIL in dual-MTA setup, or EXIM V4
# (set host and port number as required; host can be specified
# as IP address or DNS name (A or CNAME, but MX is ignored)
#$forward_method = 'smtp:127.0.0.1:10025';  # where to forward checked mail
#$notify_method = $forward_method;          # where to submit notifications

# NOTE: The defaults (above) are good for Postfix or dual-sendmail. You MUST
#       uncomment the approprate settings below if using other setups!

# SENDMAIL MILTER, using amavis-milter.c helper program:
#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, sendmail does it by itself
# milter; option -odd is needed to avoid deadlocks
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -odd -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
# just a thought: can we use use -Am instead of -odd ?

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, as relay):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -C/etc/sendmail.orig.cf -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# SENDMAIL (old non-milter setup, amavis.c calls local delivery agent):
#$forward_method = undef;  # no explicit forwarding, amavis.c will call LDA
#$notify_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/sendmail -Ac -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';

# EXIM v3 (not recommended with v4 or later, which can use SMTP setup instead):
#$forward_method = 'pipe:flags=q argv=/usr/sbin/exim -oMr scanned-ok -i -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}';
#$notify_method = $forward_method;

# prefer to collect mail for forwarding as BSMTP files?
#$forward_method = "bsmtp:$MYHOME/out-%i-%n.bsmtp";
#$notify_method = $forward_method;


# Net::Server pre-forking settings
# You may want $max_servers to match the width of your MTA pipe
# feeding amavisd, e.g. with Postfix the 'Max procs' field in the
# master.cf file, like the '2' in the:  smtp-amavis unix - - n - 2 smtp
#
$max_servers  =  2;   # number of pre-forked children          (default 2)
$max_requests = 10;   # retire a child after that many accepts (default 10)

$child_timeout=5*60;  # abort child if it does not complete each task in n sec
                      # (default: 8*60 seconds)

# Check also the settings of @av_scanners at the end if you want to use
# virus scanners. If not, you may want to delete the whole long assignment
# to the variable @av_scanners, which will also remove the virus checking
# code (e.g. if you only want to do spam scanning).

# Here is a QUICK WAY to completely DISABLE some sections of code
# that WE DO NOT WANT (it won't even be compiled-in).
# For more refined controls leave the following two lines commented out,
# and see further down what these two lookup lists really mean.
#
@bypass_virus_checks_acl = qw( . );  # uncomment to DISABLE anti-virus code
# @bypass_spam_checks_acl  = qw( . );  # uncomment to DISABLE anti-spam code
#
# Any setting can be changed with a new assignment, so make sure
# you do not unintentionally override these settings further down!


# Lookup list of local domains (see README.lookups for syntax details)
#
# NOTE:
#   For backwards compatibility the variable names @local_domains (old) and
#   @local_domains_acl (new) are synonyms. For consistency with other lookups
#   the name @local_domains_acl is now preferred. It also makes it more
#   obviously distinct from the new %local_domains hash lookup table.
#
# local_domains* lookup tables are used in deciding whether a recipient
# is local or not, or in other words, if the message is outgoing or not.
# This affects inserting spam-related headers for local recipients,
# limiting recipient virus notifications (if enabled) to local recipients,
# in deciding if address extension may be appended, and in SQL lookups
# for non-fqdn addresses. Set it up correctly if you need features
# that rely on this setting (or just leave empty otherwise).
#
# With Postfix (2.0) a quick reminder on what local domains normally are:
# a union of domains spacified in: $mydestination, $virtual_alias_domains,
# $virtual_mailbox_domains, and $relay_domains.
#
@local_domains_acl = ( ".$mydomain" );  # $mydomain and its subdomains
# @local_domains_acl = qw();  # default is empty, no recipient treated as local
# @local_domains_acl = qw( .example.com );
# @local_domains_acl = qw( .example.com !host.sub.example.net .sub.example.net );
# @local_domains_acl = ( ".$mydomain", '.example.com', 'sub.example.net' );

# or alternatively(A), using a Perl hash lookup table, which may be assigned
# directly, or read from a file, one domain per line; comments and empty lines
# are ignored, a dot before a domain name implies its subdomains:
#
#read_hash(\%local_domains, '/var/amavis/local_domains');

#or alternatively(B), using a list of regular expressions:
# $local_domains_re = new_RE( qr'[@.]example\.com$'i );
#
# see README.lookups for syntax and semantics


#
# Section II - MTA specific (defaults should be ok)
#

# if $relayhost_is_client is true, IP address in $notify_method and
# $forward_method is dynamically overridden with SMTP client peer address
# if available, which makes possible for several hosts to share one daemon
#$relayhost_is_client = 1;        # (defaults to false)

#$insert_received_line = 1;       # behave like MTA: insert 'Received:' header
			          # (does not apply to sendmail/milter)
			          # (default is true)

# AMAVIS-CLIENT PROTOCOL INPUT SETTINGS (e.g. with sendmail milter)
#   (used with amavis helper clients like amavis-milter.c and amavis.c,
#   NOT needed for Postfix and Exim)
$unix_socketname = "$MYHOME/amavisd.sock"; # amavis helper protocol socket
#$unix_socketname = undef;        # disable listening on a unix socket
                                  # (default is undef, i.e. disabled)
                                  # (usual setting is $MYHOME/amavisd.sock)

# Do we receive quoted or raw addresses from the helper program?
# (does not apply to SMTP;  defaults to true)
#$gets_addr_in_quoted_form = 1;   # "Bob \"Funny\" Dude"@example.com
#$gets_addr_in_quoted_form = 0;   # Bob "Funny" Dude@example.com



# SMTP SERVER (INPUT) PROTOCOL SETTINGS (e.g. with Postfix, Exim v4, ...)
#   (used when MTA is configured to pass mail to amavisd via SMTP or LMTP)
$inet_socket_port = 10024;        # accept SMTP on this local TCP port
                                  # (default is undef, i.e. disabled)
# multiple ports may be provided: $inet_socket_port = [10024, 10026, 10028];

# SMTP SERVER (INPUT) access control
# - do not allow free access to the amavisd SMTP port !!!
#
# when MTA is at the same host, use the following (one or the other or both):
#$inet_socket_bind = '127.0.0.1'; # limit socket bind to loopback interface
                                  # (default is '127.0.0.1')
@inet_acl = qw( 127.0.0.1 );      # allow SMTP access only from localhost IP
                                  # (default is qw( 127.0.0.1 ) )

# when MTA (one or more) is on a different host, use the following:
#@inet_acl = qw(127/8 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2);  # adjust the list as appropriate
#$inet_socket_bind = undef;       # bind to all IP interfaces

#
# Example1:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# permit only SMTP access from loopback and rfc1918 private address space
#
# Example2:
# @inet_acl = qw( !192.168.1.12 172.16.3.3 !172.16.3/255.255.255.0
#		  127.0.0.1 10/8 172.16/12 192.168/16 );
# matches loopback and rfc1918 private address space except host 192.168.1.12
# and net 172.16.3/24 (but host 172.16.3.3 within 172.16.3/24 still matches)
#
# Example3:
# @inet_acl = qw( 127/8
#		  !172.16.3.0   !172.16.3.127 172.16.3.0/25
#		  !172.16.3.128 !172.16.3.255 172.16.3.128/25 );
# matches loopback and both halves of the 172.16.3/24 C-class,
# split into two subnets, except all four broadcast addresses
# for these subnets
#
# See README.lookups for details on specifying access control lists.


#
# Section III - Logging
#

# true (e.g. 1) => syslog;  false (e.g. 0) => logging to file
$DO_SYSLOG = 0;                   # (defaults to false)
#$SYSLOG_LEVEL = 'user.info';     # (defaults to 'mail.info')

# Log file (if not using syslog)
$LOGFILE = "/var/log/amavis.log";  # (defaults to empty, no log)

#NOTE: levels are not strictly observed and are somewhat arbitrary
# 0: startup/exit/failure messages, viruses detected
# 1: args passed from client, some more interesting messages
# 2: virus scanner output, timing
# 3: server, client
# 4: decompose parts
# 5: more debug details
$log_level = 2;		  # (defaults to 0)

# Customizeable template for the most interesting log file entry (e.g. with
# $log_level=0) (take care to properly quote Perl special characters like '\')
# For a list of available macros see README.customize .

# only log infected messages (useful with log level 0):
# $log_templ = '[? %#V |[? %#F ||banned filename ([%F|,])]|infected ([%V|,])]#
# [? %#V |[? %#F ||, from=<%o>, to=[<%R>|,][? %i ||, quarantine %i]]#
# |, from=<%o>, to=[<%R>|,][? %i ||, quarantine %i]]';

# log both infected and noninfected messages (default):
$log_templ = '[? %#V |[? %#F |[?%#D|Not-Delivered|Passed]|BANNED name/type (%F)]|INFECTED (%V)], #
<%o> -> [<%R>|,][? %i ||, quarantine %i], Message-ID: %m, Hits: %c';


#
# Section IV - Notifications/DSN, BOUNCE/REJECT/DROP/PASS destiny, quarantine
#

# Select notifications text encoding when Unicode-aware Perl is converting
# text from internal character representation to external encoding (charset
# in MIME terminology)
#
#   to be used in RFC 2047-encoded header field bodies, e.g. in Subject:
#$hdr_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # (default: 'iso-8859-1')
#
#   to be used in notification body text: its encoding and Content-type.charset
#$bdy_encoding = 'iso-8859-1';  # (default: 'iso-8859-1')

# Default template texts for notifications may be overruled by directly
# assigning new text to template variables, or by reading template text
# from files. A second argument may be specified in a call to read_text(),
# specifying character encoding layer to be used when reading from the
# external file, e.g. 'utf8', 'iso-8859-1', or often just $bdy_encoding.
# Text will be converted to internal character representation by Perl 5.8.0
# or later; second argument is ignored otherwise. See PerlIO::encoding,
# Encode::PerlIO and perluniintro man pages.
#
# $notify_sender_templ      = read_text('/var/amavis/notify_sender.txt');
# $notify_virus_sender_templ= read_text('/var/amavis/notify_virus_sender.txt');
# $notify_virus_admin_templ = read_text('/var/amavis/notify_virus_admin.txt');
# $notify_virus_recips_templ= read_text('/var/amavis/notify_virus_recips.txt');
# $notify_spam_sender_templ = read_text('/var/amavis/notify_spam_sender.txt');
# $notify_spam_admin_templ  = read_text('/var/amavis/notify_spam_admin.txt');

# If notification template files are collectively available in some directory,
# use read_l10n_templates which calls read_text for each known template.
#
#   read_l10n_templates('/etc/amavis/en_US');


# Here is an overall picture (sequence of events) of how pieces fit together
# (only virus controls are shown, spam controls work the same way):
#
#   bypass_virus_checks set for all recipients? ==> PASS
#   no viruses?   ==> PASS
#   log virus     if $log_templ is nonempty
#   quarantine    if $virus_quarantine_to is nonempty
#   notify admin  if $virus_admin (lookup) nonempty
#   notify recips if $warnvirusrecip and (recipient is local or $warn_offsite)
#   add address extensions for local recipients (when enabled)
#   send (non-)delivery notifications
#      to sender if DSN needed (BOUNCE) or ($warnvirussender and D_PASS)
#   virus_lovers or final_destiny==D_PASS  ==> PASS
#   DISCARD (2xx) or REJECT (5xx) (depending on final_*_destiny)
#
# Equivalent flow diagram applies for spam checks.
# If a virus is detected, spam checking is skipped entirely.

# The following symbolic constants can be used in *destiny settings:
#
# D_PASS     mail will pass to recipients, regardless of bad contents;
#
# D_DISCARD  mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender will NOT be
#            notified. Effectively we lose mail (but will be quarantined
#            unless disabled). Not a decent thing to do for a mailer.
#
# D_BOUNCE   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, a non-delivery
#            notification (bounce) will be sent to the sender by amavisd-new;
#            Exception: bounce (DSN) will not be sent if a virus name matches
#            $viruses_that_fake_sender_re, or to messages from mailing lists
#            (Precedence: bulk|list|junk);
#
# D_REJECT   mail will not be delivered to its recipients, sender should
#            preferably get a reject, e.g. SMTP permanent reject response
#            (e.g. with milter), or non-delivery notification from MTA
#            (e.g. Postfix). If this is not possible (e.g. different recipients
#            have different tolerances to bad mail contents and not using LMTP)
#            amavisd-new sends a bounce by itself (same as D_BOUNCE).
#
# Notes:
#   D_REJECT and D_BOUNCE are similar, the difference is in who is responsible
#            for informing the sender about non-delivery, and how informative
#            the notification can be (amavisd-new knows more than MTA);
#   With D_REJECT, MTA may reject original SMTP, or send DSN (delivery status
#            notification, colloquially called 'bounce') - depending on MTA;
#            Best suited for sendmail milter, especially for spam.
#   With D_BOUNCE, amavisd-new (not MTA) sends DSN (can better explain the
#            reason for mail non-delivery, but unable to reject the original
#            SMTP session). Best suited to reporting viruses, and for Postfix
#            and other dual-MTA setups, which can't reject original client SMTP
#            session, as the mail has already been enqueued.

$final_virus_destiny      = D_DISCARD;  # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_banned_destiny     = D_BOUNCE;  # (defaults to D_BOUNCE)
$final_spam_destiny       = D_PASS;  # (defaults to D_REJECT)
$final_bad_header_destiny = D_PASS;  # (defaults to D_PASS), D_BOUNCE suggested

# Alternatives to consider for spam:
# - use D_PASS if clients will do filtering based on inserted mail headers;
# - use D_DISCARD, if kill_level is set safely high;
# - use D_BOUNCE instead of D_REJECT if not using milter;
#
# There are no sensible alternatives to D_BOUNCE for viruses, but consider:
# - use D_PASS (or virus_lovers) and $warnvirussender=1 to deliver viruses;
# - use D_REJECT instead of D_BOUNCE if using milter and under heavy
#   virus storm;
#
# Don't bother to set both D_DISCARD and $warn*sender=1, it will get mapped
# to D_BOUNCE.
#
# The separation of *_destiny values into D_BOUNCE, D_REJECT, D_DISCARD
# and D_PASS made settings $warnvirussender and $warnspamsender only still
# useful with D_PASS.

# The following $warn*sender settings are ONLY used when mail is
# actually passed to recipients ($final_*_destiny=D_PASS, or *_lovers*).
# Bounces or rejects produce non-delivery status notification anyway.

# Notify virus sender?
#$warnvirussender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify spam sender?
#$warnspamsender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify sender of banned files?
#$warnbannedsender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify sender of syntactically invalid header containing non-ASCII characters?
#$warnbadhsender = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify virus (or banned files) RECIPIENT?
#  (not very useful, but some policies demand it)
#$warnvirusrecip = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))
#$warnbannedrecip = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef))

# Notify also non-local virus/banned recipients if $warn*recip is true?
#  (including those not matching local_domains*)
#$warn_offsite = 1;	# (defaults to false (undef), i.e. only notify locals)


# Treat envelope sender address as unreliable and don't send sender
# notification / bounces if name(s) of detected virus(es) match the list.
# Note that virus names are supplied by external virus scanner(s) and are
# not standardized, so virus names may need to be adjusted.
# See README.lookups for syntax.

#$virus_quarantine_method = "bsmtp:$QUARANTINEDIR/virus-%i-%n.bsmtp";
#$spam_quarantine_method  = "bsmtp:$QUARANTINEDIR/spam-%b-%i-%n.bsmtp";

# When using the 'local:' quarantine method (default), the following applies:
#
# A finer control of quarantining is available through variable
# $virus_quarantine_to/$spam_quarantine_to. It may be a simple scalar string,
# or a ref to a hash lookup table, or a regexp lookup table object,
# which makes possible to set up per-recipient quarantine addresses.
#
# The value of scalar $virus_quarantine_to/$spam_quarantine_to (or a
# per-recipient lookup result from the hash table %$virus_quarantine_to)
# is/are interpreted as follows:
#
# VARIANT 1:
#   empty or undef disables quarantine;
#
# VARIANT 2:
#   a string NOT containg an '@';
# amavisd will behave as a local delivery agent (LDA) and will quarantine
# viruses to local files according to hash %local_delivery_aliases (pseudo
# aliases map) - see subroutine mail_to_local_mailbox() for details.
# Some of the predefined aliases are 'virus-quarantine' and 'spam-quarantine'.
# Setting $virus_quarantine_to ($spam_quarantine_to) to this string will:
#
# * if $QUARANTINEDIR is a directory, each quarantined virus will go
#   to a separate file in the $QUARANTINEDIR directory (traditional
#   amavis style, similar to maildir mailbox format);
#
# * otherwise $QUARANTINEDIR is treated as a file name of a Unix-style
#   mailbox. All quarantined messages will be appended to this file.
#   Amavisd child process must obtain an exclusive lock on the file during
#   delivery, so this may be less efficient than using individual files
#   or forwarding to MTA, and it may not work across NFS or other non-local
#   file systems (but may be handy for pickup of quarantined files via IMAP
#   for example);
#
# VARIANT 3:
#   any email address (must contain '@').
# The e-mail messages to be quarantined will be handed to MTA
# for delivery to the specified address. If a recipient address local to MTA
# is desired, you may leave the domain part empty, e.g. 'infected@', but the
# '@' character must nevertheless be included to distinguish it from variant 2.
#
# This method enables more refined delivery control made available by MTA
# (e.g. its aliases file, other local delivery agents, dealing with
# privileges and file locking when delivering to user's mailbox, nonlocal
# delivery and forwarding, fan-out lists). Make sure the mail-to-be-quarantined
# will not be handed back to amavisd for checking, as this will cause a loop
# (hopefully broken at some stage)! If this can be assured, notifications
# will benefit too from not being unecessarily virus-scanned.
#
# By default this is safe to do with Postfix and Exim v4 and dual-sendmail
# setup, but probably not safe with sendmail milter interface without
# precaution.

#    raw (encoded) form and in rfc2047-decoded form if applicable;
#
#  * file content type as guessed by 'file(1)' utility, both the raw result
#    from file(1), as well as short type name, classified into names such as
#    .asc, .txt, .html, .doc, .jpg, .pdf, .zip, .exe, ..., which is always
#    beginning with a dot - see subroutine determine_file_types().

#
#  * leave $banned_filename_re undefined to disable these checks
#    (giving an empty list to new_RE() will also always return false)

# A little trick: a pattern qr'\.exe$' matches both a short type name '.exe',
# as well as any file name which happens to end with .exe. If only matching
# a file name is desired, but not the short name, a pattern qr'.\.exe$'i
# or similar may be used, which requires that at least one character preceeds

#
# Section V - Per-recipient and per-sender handling, whitelisting, etc.
#

# %virus_lovers, @virus_lovers_acl and $virus_lovers_re lookup tables:
#   (these should be considered policy options, they do not disable checks,
#   see bypas*checks for that!)
#
# Exclude certain RECIPIENTS from virus filtering by adding their lower-cased
# envelope e-mail address (or domain only) to the hash %virus_lovers, or to
# the access list @virus_lovers_acl - see README.lookups and examples.
# Make sure the appropriate form (e.g. external/internal) of address
# is used in case of virtual domains, or when mapping external to internal
# addresses, etc. - this is MTA-specific.
#
# Notifications would still be generated however (see the overall
# picture above), and infected mail (if passed) gets additional header:
#   X-AMaViS-Alert: INFECTED, message contains virus: ...
# (header not inserted with milter interface!)
#
# NOTE (milter interface only): in case of multiple recipients,
# it is only possible to drop or accept the message in its entirety - for all
# recipients. If all of them are virus lovers, we'll accept mail, but if
# at least one recipient is not a virus lover, we'll discard the message.


# %bypass_virus_checks, @bypass_virus_checks_acl and $bypass_virus_checks_re
# lookup tables:
#   (this is mainly a time-saving option, unlike virus_lovers* !)
#
# Similar in concept to %virus_lovers, a hash %bypass_virus_checks,
# access list @bypass_virus_checks_acl and regexp list $bypass_virus_checks_re
# are used to skip entirely the decoding, unpacking and virus checking,
# but only if ALL recipients match the lookup.
#
# %bypass_virus_checks/@bypass_virus_checks_acl/$bypass_virus_checks_re
# do NOT GUARANTEE the message will NOT be checked for viruses - this may
# still happen when there is more than one recipient for a message, and
# not all of them match these lookup tables. To guarantee virus delivery,
# a recipient must also match %virus_lovers/@virus_lovers_acl lookups
# (but see milter limitations above),

# NOTE: it would not be clever to base virus checks on SENDER address,
# since there are no guarantees that it is genuine. Many viruses
# and spam messages fake sender address. To achieve selective filtering
# based on the source of the mail (e.g. IP address, MTA port number, ...),
# use mechanisms provided by MTA if available.


# Similar to lookup tables controlling virus checking, there exist
# spam scanning, banned names/types, and headers_checks control counterparts:
#   %spam_lovers, @spam_lovers_acl, $spam_lovers_re
#   %banned_files_lovers, @banned_files_lovers_acl, $banned_files_lovers_re
#   %bad_header_lovers, @bad_header_lovers_acl, $bad_header_lovers_re
# and:
#   %bypass_spam_checks/@bypass_spam_checks_acl/$bypass_spam_checks_re
#   %bypass_banned_checks/@bypass_banned_checks_acl/$bypass_banned_checks_re
#   %bypass_header_checks/@bypass_header_checks_acl/$bypass_header_checks_re
# See README.lookups for details about the syntax.

# The following example disables spam checking altogether,
# since it matches any recipient e-mail address (any address
# is a subdomain of the top-level root DNS domain):
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( . );

#   @bypass_header_checks_acl = qw( user@example.com );
#   @bad_header_lovers_acl    = qw( user@example.com );


# See README.lookups for further detail, and examples below.

# $virus_lovers{lc("postmaster\@$mydomain")} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('postmaster@example.com')} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('abuse@example.com')} = 1;
# $virus_lovers{lc('some.user@')} = 1;  # this recipient, regardless of domain
# $virus_lovers{lc('boss@example.com')} = 0; # never, even if domain matches
# $virus_lovers{lc('example.com')} = 1; # this domain, but not its subdomains
# $virus_lovers{lc('.example.com')}= 1; # this domain, including its subdomains
#or:
# @virus_lovers_acl = qw( me@lab.xxx.com !lab.xxx.com .xxx.com yyy.org );
#
# $bypass_virus_checks{lc('some.user2@butnot.example.com')} = 1;

# @virus_lovers_acl = qw( postmaster@example.com );
# $virus_lovers_re = new_RE( qr'(helpdesk|postmaster)@example\.com$'i );

# $spam_lovers{lc("postmaster\@$mydomain")} = 1;
# $spam_lovers{lc('postmaster@example.com')} = 1;
# $spam_lovers{lc('abuse@example.com')} = 1;
# @spam_lovers_acl = qw( !.example.com );
# $spam_lovers_re = new_RE( qr'^user@example\.com$'i );


# don't run spam check for these RECIPIENT domains:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( d1.com .d2.com a.d3.com );
# or the other way around (bypass check for all BUT these):
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = qw( !d1.com !.d2.com !a.d3.com . );
# a practical application: don't check outgoing mail for spam:
#   @bypass_spam_checks_acl = ( "!.$mydomain", "." );
# (a downside of which is that such mail will not count as ham in SA bayes db)


# Where to find SQL server(s) and database to support SQL lookups?
# A list of triples: (dsn,user,passw).   (dsn = data source name)
# Specify more than one for multiple (backup) SQL servers.
# See 'man DBI', 'man DBD::mysql', 'DBD::Pg', ... for details.
#

#     ['DBI:mysql:mail:host2', 'some-username2', 'some-password2'] );
# ('mail' in the example is the database name, choose what you like)
# With PostgreSQL the dsn (first element of the triple) may look like:
#      'DBI:Pg:host=host1;dbname=mail'

# The SQL select clause to fetch per-recipient policy settings.
# The %k will be replaced by a comma-separated list of query addresses
# (e.g. full address, domain only, catchall).  Use ORDER, if there
# is a chance that multiple records will match - the first match wins.
# If field names are not unique (e.g. 'id'), the later field overwrites the
# earlier in a hash returned by lookup, which is why we use '*,users.id'.
# No need to uncomment the following assignment if the default is ok.
#   $sql_select_policy = 'SELECT *,users.id FROM users,policy'.
#     ' WHERE (users.policy_id=policy.id) AND (users.email IN (%k))'.
#     ' ORDER BY users.priority DESC';
#
# The SQL select clause to check sender in per-recipient whitelist/blacklist
# The first SELECT argument '?' will be users.id from recipient SQL lookup,
# the %k will be sender addresses (e.g. full address, domain only, catchall).
# The default value is:
#   $sql_select_white_black_list = 'SELECT wb FROM wblist,mailaddr'.
#     ' WHERE (rid=?) AND (sid=mailaddr.id) AND (mailaddr.email IN (%k))'.
#     ' ORDER BY mailaddr.priority DESC';
#
# To disable SQL white/black list, set to undef (otherwise comment-out
# the following statement, leaving it at the default value):
$sql_select_white_black_list = undef;  # undef disables SQL white/blacklisting


# If you decide to pass viruses (or spam) to certain recipients using the
# above lookup tables or using $final_virus_destiny=1, you can set
# the variable $addr_extension_virus ($addr_extension_spam) to some
# string, and the recipient address will have this string appended
# as an address extension to the local-part of the address. This extension
# can be used by final local delivery agent to place such mail in different
# folders. Leave these two variables undefined or empty strings to prevent
# appending address extensions. Setting has no effect on recipient which will
# not be receiving viruses/spam. Recipients who do not match lookup tables
# local_domains* are not affected.
#
# LDAs usually default to stripping away address extension if no special
# handling is specified, so having this option enabled normally does no harm,
# provided the $recipients_delimiter matches the setting on the final
# MTA's LDA.

# $addr_extension_virus  = 'virus';	# (default is undef, same as empty)
# $addr_extension_spam   = 'spam';	# (default is undef, same as empty)

# Delimiter between local part of the recipient address and address extension
# (which can optionally be added, see variables $addr_extension_virus and
# $addr_extension_spam). E.g. recipient address <user@example.com> gets changed
# to <user+virus@example.com>.
#
# Delimiter should match equivalent (final) MTA delimiter setting.
# (e.g. for Postfix add 'recipient_delimiter = +' to main.cf)
# Setting it to an empty string or to undef disables this feature
# regardless of $addr_extension_virus and $addr_extension_spam settings.

# ENVELOPE SENDER WHITELISTING / BLACKLISTING  - GLOBAL (RECIPIENT-INDEPENDENT)

# WHITELISTING: use ENVELOPE SENDER lookups to ENSURE DELIVERY from whitelisted
# senders even if the message is recognized as spam. Effectively, for the
# specified senders, message RECIPIENTS temporarily become 'spam_lovers', with
# further processing being the same as otherwise specified for spam lovers.
# It does not turn off inserting spam-related headers, if they are enabled.
#
# BLACKLISTING: messages from specified SENDERS are DECLARED SPAM.
# Effectively, for messages from blacklisted senders, spam level
# is artificially pushed high, and the normal spam processing applies,
# resulting in 'X-Spam-Flag: YES', high 'X-Spam-Level' bar and other usual
# reactions to spam, including possible rejection. If the message nevertheless
# still passes (e.g. for spam loving recipients), it is tagged as BLACKLISTED
# in the 'X-Spam-Status' header field, but the reported spam value and
# set of tests in this report header field (if available from SpamAssassin,
# which may have not been called) is not adjusted.
#
# A sender may be both white- and blacklisted at the same time,
# settings are independent. For example, being both white- and blacklisted,
# message is delivered to recipients, but is tagged as spam.
#
# If ALL recipients of the message either white- or blacklist the sender,
# spam scanning (calling the SpamAssassin) is bypassed, saving on time.
#
# The following variables (lookup tables) are available, with the semantics
# and syntax as specified in README.lookups:
#
# %whitelist_sender, @whitelist_sender_acl, $whitelist_sender_re
# %blacklist_sender, @blacklist_sender_acl, $blacklist_sender_re

# SOME EXAMPLES:
#
#ACL:
# @whitelist_sender_acl = qw( .example.com );
#
# @whitelist_sender_acl = ( ".$mydomain" );  # $mydomain and its subdomains
# NOTE: This is not a reliable way of turning off spam checks for
#       locally-originating mail, as sender address can easily be faked.
#       To reliably avoid spam-scanning outgoing mail,
#       use @bypass_spam_checks_acl .

#RE:
# $whitelist_sender_re = new_RE(
#   qr'^postmaster@.*\bexample\.com$'i,

# @av_scanners is a list of n-tuples, where fields semantics is:
#  1. av scanner plain name, to be used in log and reports;
#  2. scanner program name; this string will be submitted to subroutine
#     find_external_programs(), which will try to find the full program
#     path name; if program is not found, this scanner is disabled.
#     Besides a simple string (full program path name or just the basename
#     to be looked for in PATH), this may be an array ref of alternative
#     program names or full paths - the first match in the list will be used;
#     As a special case for more complex scanners, this field may be
#     a subroutine reference, and the whole n-tuple is passed to it as args.
#  3. command arguments to be given to the scanner program;
#     a substring {} will be replaced by the directory name to be scanned,
#     i.e. "$tempdir/parts"
#  4. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating NO VIRUSES found;
#  5. an array ref of av scanner exit status values, or a regexp (to be
#     matched against scanner output), indicating VIRUSES WERE FOUND;
#     Note: the virus match prevails over a 'not found' match, so it is safe
#     even if 4. matches for viruses too;
#  6. a regexp (to be matched against scanner output), returning a list
#     of virus names found.
#  7. and 8.: (optional) subroutines to be executed before and after scanner
#     (e.g. to set environment or current directory);
#     see examples for these at KasperskyLab AVP and Sophos sweep.

# NOTES:
#
# - NOT DEFINING @av_scanners (e.g. setting it to empty list, or deleting the
#   whole assignment) TURNS OFF LOADING AND COMPILING OF THE ANTIVIRUS CODE
#   (which can be handy if all you want to do is spam scanning);
#
# - the order matters: although _all_ available entries from the list are
#   always tried regardless of their verdict, scanners are run in the order
#   specified: the report from the first one detecting a virus will be used
#   (providing virus names and scanner output); REARRANGE THE ORDER TO WILL;
#
# - it doesn't hurt to keep an unused command line scanner entry in the list
#   if the program can not be found; the path search is only performed once
#   during the program startup;
#
#   CORROLARY: to disable a scanner that _does_ exist on your system,
#   comment out its entry or use undef or '' as its program name/path
#   (second parameter). An example where this is almost a must: disable
#   Sophos 'sweep' if you have its daemonized version Sophie or SAVI-Perl
#   (same for Trophie/vscan, and clamd/clamscan), or if another unrelated
#   program happens to have a name matching one of the entries ('sweep'
#   again comes to mind);
#
# - it DOES HURT to keep unwanted entries which use INTERNAL SUBROUTINES
#   for interfacing (where the second parameter starts with \&).
#   Keeping such entry and not having a corresponding virus scanner daemon
#   causes an unnecessary connection attempt (which eventually times out,
#   but it wastes precious time). For this reason the daemonized entries
#   are commented in the distribution - just remove the '#' where needed.

# from a terminal window:  # amavisd debug

# Some more refined approaches:

# If sender matches ACL, turn debugging fully up, just for this one message
#@debug_sender_acl = ( "test-sender\@$mydomain" );
#@debug_sender_acl = qw( debug@example.com );

# May be useful along with @debug_sender_acl:
# Prevent all decoded originals being deleted (replaced by decoded part)
#$keep_decoded_original_re = new_RE( qr/.*/ );

# Turn on SpamAssassin debugging (output to STDERR, use with 'amavisd debug')
#$sa_debug = 1;            # defaults to false

1;  # insure a defined return
