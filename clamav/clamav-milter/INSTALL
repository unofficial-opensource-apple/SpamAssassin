BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

A makefile was supplied with this which should have built the program. If it
fails please let us know, and here are some hints for building on different
platforms.

Tested OK on Linux/x86 with gcc3.2.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o

Compiles OK on Linux/x86 with tcc 0.9.16, but fails to link errors with 'atexit'
	tcc -g -b -lmilter -lpthread clamav-milter.c...

Fails to compile on Linux/x86 with icc6.0 (complains about stdio.h...)
	icc -O3 -tpp7 -xiMKW -ipo -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 clamav-milter.c...
Fails to build on Linux/x86 with icc7.1 with -ipo (fails on libclamav.a - keeps saying run ranlib). Otherwise it builds and runs OK.
	icc -O2 -tpp7 -xiMKW -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 -march=pentium4 -mcpu=pentium4 clamav-milter.c...

Tested with Electric Fence 2.2.2

Compiles OK on Linux/ppc (YDL2.3) with gcc2.95.4. Needs -lsmutil to link.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loop -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lsmutil
I haven't tested it further on this platform yet.
YDL3.0 should compile out of the box

Sendmail on MacOS/X (10.1) is provided without a development package so this
can't be run "out of the box"

Solaris 8 doesn't have milter support so clamav-milter won't work unless you
rebuild sendmail from source.

FreeBSD4.7 use /usr/local/bin/gcc30. GCC3.0 is an optional extra on
FreeBSD. It comes with getopt.h which is handy. To link you need
-lgnugetopt
	gcc30 -O3 -DCONFDIR=\"/usr/local/etc\" -I. -I.. -I../clamd -I../libclamav -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lgnugetopt

FreeBSD4.8: compiles out of the box with either gcc2.95 or gcc3

OpenBSD3.4: the supplied sendmail does not come with Milter support.
Do this *before* running configure (thanks for Per-Olov Sjöhol
<peo_s@incedo.org> for these instructions).

	echo WANT_LIBMILTER=1 > /etc/mk.conf
	cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail
	make depend
	make
	make install
	kill -HUP `sed q /var/run/sendmail.pid`

Then do this to make the milter headers available to clamav...
(the libmilter.a file is already in the right place after the sendmail
recompiles above)

	cd /usr/include
	ln -s ../src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/include/libmilter libmilter

Solaris 9 and FreeBSD5 have milter support in the supplied sendmail, but
doesn't include libmilter so you can't develop milter applications on it.
Go to sendmail.org, download the lastest sendmail, cd to libmilter and
"make install" there.

Needs -lresolv on Solaris

INSTALLATION

Install into /usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter.

Ensure that your sendmail supports milters by running
	/usr/lib/sendmail -d0 < /dev/null | fgrep MILTER
or
	/usr/sbin/sendmail -d0 < /dev/null | fgrep MILTER

You should see something like:
	MATCHGECOS MILTER MIME7TO8 MIME8TO7 NAMED_BIND NETINET NETINET6
It doesn't matter exactly what you see, as long as the word MILTER is printed.

If you see no output you MUST upgrade your sendmail.

See http://www.nmt.edu/~wcolburn/sendmail-8.12.5/libmilter/docs/sample.html

Installations for RedHat Linux and it's derivatives such as YellowDog:
	Ensure that you have the sendmail-devel RPM installed
	Add to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `clamav')

	Check entry in /usr/local/etc/clamd.conf of the form:
	LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock

	If you already have a filter (such as spamassassin-milter from
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/spamass-milt) add it thus:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spamassassin', `S=local:/var/run/spamass.sock, F=, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `spamassassin,clamav')dnl

	mkdir /var/run/clamav
	chown clamav /var/run/clamav	(if you use User clamav in clamd.conf)
	chmod 700 /var/run/clamav

	Where /var/run/spamass.sock is the location of the spamass-milt
	socket file (on some systems it is in /var/run/sendmail/spamass.sock).

You may find INPUT_MAIL_FILTERS is not needed on your machine, however it
is recommended by the Sendmail documentation and I recommend going along
with that.

If you see an unsafe socket error from sendmail, it means that the permissions
of the /var/run/clamav directory are too open. Check you have correctly run
chown and chmod, it may also mean that clamav-milter hasn't started, run
ps and check your logs.

The above example shows clamav-milter, clamd and sendmail all on the
same machine, however using TCP they may reside on different machines,
indeed clamav-milter is capable of talking to multiple clamds for redundancy
and load balancing.

I suggest putting SpamAssassin first since you're more likely to get spam
than a virus/worm sent to you.

Add to /etc/sysconfig/clamav-milter
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock"
or if clamd is on a different machine
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="--server=192.168.1.9 local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock"

If you want clamav-milter to listen on TCP for communication with sendmail,
for example if they are on different machines use inet:<port>.
On machine A (running sendmail) you would have in sendmail.mc:
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=inet:3311@machineb, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
On machine B (running clamav-milter) you would start up clamav-milter thus:
clamav-milter inet:3311

You should have received a script to put into /etc/init.d with this software.

You should always start clamd before clamav-milter.

As with all software it is wise to ensure that clamav-milter has the least
privileges it needs to run. So don't run it as root and don't store the sockets
in a directory that can be written by everyone. For example ensure that /var/run
is owned and writable only by root and add entries for 'User' and
'FixStaleSocket' in clamd.conf.

When using UNIX domain sockets via the LocalSocket option of clamd.conf,
we recommend that you use the --quarantine-dir option since that may improve
performance.

		determine if strerror_r exists
0.70	17/3/04	Up-issued to 0.70

		clamfi_connect: print better message if hostaddr is null
0.70o	20/4/04	Added X-Virus-Status
		Always add X-Virus-Scanned

0.70q	22/4/04	No need to parse the received line if --headers is given
		If -outgoing is given put generated emails in the deferred
			queue to avoid the milter being called twice at the
			same time (one on the incoming one on the outgoing)
		header_list_print, ensure From lines are escaped, may not be
			needed but it is better to be on the safe side

			(TEMHOTA)" <temnota@kmv.ru>
		If CL_DEBUG is defined, don't redirect stdout/stderr
		Don't attempt to return an old signature if no filename has

0.70u	29/4/04	When changing from realloc to cli_realloc I forgot to keep the
		assignment of signature
0.70v	6/5/04	clamfi_close now always checks privdata is NULL, not only when
			debugging
		Allow transfers of exactly streamMaxLength

0.71	16/5/04	Up issue
0.71a	21/5/04	--from wasn't always a recognised option

0.71c	25/5/04	X-Virus-Status: Not Scanned - StreamMaxLength exceeded was not
			always being added
