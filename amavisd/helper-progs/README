Postfix and Exim v4
===================

You have come to the wrong subdirectory,
no helper programs are needed.


sendmail with milter
====================

For sendmail milter setup, please use the usual procedure:

  check the configure options: ./configure --help

  ./configure
  make
  make install

This should produce the program amavis-milter.

Follow the instructions in README.milter for
integrating it with sendmail.

Thanks to Stephane Lentz for providing the
configure.in/Makefile.in for this version.


older sendmail without milter
=============================

To compile just the older amavis(.c) helper program
without the benefit of the sendmail library and configure/make,
please:
- copy config.h.in to config.h
- edit config.h, adjusting the few variables as needed
- compile the program, e.g. gcc -o amavis amavis.c
  and copy it to wherever you would like to have it

Follow the instructions in README.sendmail for
integrating it with sendmail.
