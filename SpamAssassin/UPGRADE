Note for Users Upgrading to SpamAssassin 3.0.0
-----------------------------------------------

- The SpamAssassin 2.6x release series was the last set of releases to
  officially support perl versions earlier than perl 5.6.1.  If you are
  using an earlier version of perl, you will need to upgrade before you
  can use the 3.0.0 version of SpamAssassin.  You will also want to make
  sure that you have the appropriate versions of required and optional
  modules as they may have changed from old versions.  The INSTALL
  document has the modules and version requirements listed.

- See http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UpgradeTo300 for a
  supplementary list of upgrade notes.  It will be updated with any
  upgrade notes not captured in this document.

- SpamAssassin 3.0.0 has a significantly different API (Application Program
  Interface) from the 2.x series of code.  This means that if you use
  SpamAssassin through a third-party utility (milter, etc,) you need to make
  sure you have an updated version which supports 3.0.0.  See
  http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/UpgradeTo300 for information about
  third-party software.

- The --auto-whitelist, --whitelist and -a options for "spamd" and
  "spamassassin" to turn on the auto-whitelist have been removed and
  replaced by the "use_auto_whitelist" configuration option which is
  also now turned on by default.

- The --virtual-config switch for spamd had to be dropped, due to licensing
  issues.  It is replaced by the --virtual-config-dir switch.

- The "rewrite_subject" and "subject_tag" configuration options were
  deprecated and are now removed. Instead, using "rewrite_header Subject
  [your desired setting]".  e.g.

    rewrite_subject 1
    subject_tag ****SPAM(_SCORE_)****

  becomes

    rewrite_header Subject ****SPAM(_SCORE_)****

- The "sa-learn --rebuild" command has been deprecated; please use
  "sa-learn --sync" instead.  The --rebuild option will remain temporarily
  for backwards compatability.

- The Bayesian storage modules have been completely re-written and now
  include Berkeley DB (DBM) storage as well as SQL based storage (see
  sql/README.bayes for more information).  In addition, a new format
  has been introduced for the bayes database that stores tokens in fixed
  length hashes (Bayes v3).  All DBM databases should be automatically
  converted to this new format the first time they are opened for write.
  You can manually perform the upgrade by running "sa-learn --sync"
  from the command line.

  Due to the database format change, you will want to do something like
  this when upgrading:

  - stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
    during the upgrade)
  - run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip
    this step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is
    upgraded.
  - upgrade SA to 3.0.0
  - run "sa-learn --sync", which will cause the db format to be upgraded.
    if you want to see what is going on, you can add the "-D" option.
  - test the new database by running some sample mails through
    SpamAssassin, and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure
    the data looks valid.
  - start running spamassassin/spamd again

- "spamd" now has a default max-children setting of 5; no more than 5
  child scanner processes will be run in parallel.  Previously, there was
  no default limit unless you specified the "-m" switch when starting
  spamd.

- If you are using a UNIX machine with all database files on local disks,
  and no sharing of those databases across NFS filesystems, you can use a
  more efficient, but non-NFS-safe, locking mechanism.   Do this by adding
  the line "lock_method flock" to the /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
  file. This is strongly recommended if you're not using NFS, as it is
  much faster than the NFS-safe locker.

- Please note that the use of the following commandline parameters for
  spamassassin and spamd have been deprecated and may be removed in
  upcoming versions of SpamAssassin.  Please discontinue usage of these
  options:

    in the 2.6x series:		--add-from, --pipe, -F, --stop-at-threshold,
    				-S, -P (spamassassin only)
    in the 3.0.x series:	--auto-whitelist, -a, --whitelist-factory, -M,
    				--warning-from, -w, --log-to-mbox, -l

- user_scores_sql_table is no longer supported.  If you need to use a table
  name, other than the default, create a custom query using the
  user_scores_sql_custom_query config option.

- SpamAssassin runs in "taint mode" by default for improved security.
  Certain third-party modules, such as Razor v2, may be incompatible with
  taint mode. For Razor v2, you will need to be using v2.40 of
  razor-agents or higher which allows taint mode by default.  Earlier
  versions which are patched to allow taint mode may be used as well.

- 2.6x deprecated the use of the "check_bayes_db" script, and it
  has been removed in 3.0.0.  Please see the sa-learn man/pod
  documentation for more info.

- Finally, this document is likely not complete.  Other configuration
  options/arguments may have changed from older versions, etc.  It would
  be good to double-check any custom configuration options to make sure
  they're still valid.  This could be as simple as running "spamassassin
  --lint", or more complex, as required by the environment.

  An example: "require_version <version>" hasn't changed itself, but the
  internal version representation is now "x.yyyzzz" instead of "x.yz"
  which could cause issues if "require_version 3.00" is expected to work
  (it won't, it needs to be "require_version 3.000000").


Note for Users Upgrading from SpamAssassin 2.5x
-----------------------------------------------

- Due to major reliability shortcomings in the database support libraries
  other than DB_File, we now require that the DB_File module be installed
  to use SpamAssassin's Bayes rules.

  SpamAssassin will still work without DB_File installed, but the Bayes
  support will be disabled.

  If you install DB_File and wish to import old Bayes database data, each
  user with a Bayes db should run "sa-learn --import" to copy old entries
  from the other formats into a new DB_File file.

  Due to the database library change, and the change to the database
  format itself, you will want to do something like this when upgrading:

  - stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
    during the upgrade)
  - run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip
    this step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is
    upgraded.
  - install DB_File module if necessary
  - upgrade SA to 3.0.0
  - if you were using another database module previously, run "sa-learn
    --import" to migrate the data into new DB_File files
  - run "sa-learn --sync", which will cause the db format to be upgraded.
    if you want to see what is going on, you can add the "-D" option.
  - test the new database by running some sample mails through
    SpamAssassin, and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure
    the data looks valid.
  - start running spamassassin/spamd again

  Obviously the steps will be different depending on your environment, but
  you get the idea. :)


Note For Users Upgrading From SpamAssassin 2.3x or 2.4x
-------------------------------------------------------

- SpamAssassin no longer includes code to handle local mail delivery, as
  it was not reliable enough, compared to procmail.  So now, if you relied
  on spamassassin to write the mail into your mail folder, you'll have to
  change your setup to use procmail as detailed below.  If you used
  spamassassin to filter your mail and then something else wrote it into a
  folder for you, then you should be fine.

- Support for versions of the optional Mail::Audit module is no longer
  included.

- The default mode of tagging (which used to be ***SPAM*** in the subject
  line) no longer takes place.  Instead the message is rewritten. If an
  incoming message is tagged as spam, instead of modifying the original
  message, SpamAssassin will create a new report message and attach the
  original message as a message/rfc822 MIME part (ensuring the original
  message is completely preserved and easier to recover).  If you do not
  want to modify the body of incoming spam, use the "report_safe" option.
  The "report_header" and "defang_mime" options have been removed as a
  result.
